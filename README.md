# Pokémon List – Interview Test

This project is a coding exercise for an interview.  
It is built with **Next.js 15** and demonstrates server-side data fetching, filtering, and pagination.

## Features

- Fetches all Pokémon types on the server.
- Displays a list of Pokémon with:
  - **Filter by type** (single or multiple).
  - **Pagination** with server-side handling.
- Uses **search params** (`?type=...&page=...`) to control filters and pagination.
- Implemented using **Server Components** in Next.js App Router.

```bash
yarn dev
